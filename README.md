# Axonibyte Java Library Suite - Database

Copyright (c) 2021-2024 Axonibyte Innovations, LLC. All rights reserved.

This Java library handles database interactions, SQL parsing, and table mappings
for Java software. While there are a variety of libraries available to interact
with SQL databases, none of them are very intuitive when it comes to working
with the queries themselves. Libraries that assist in SQL building are often not
free. This library takes care of both use cases.
